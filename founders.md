# ðŸ“™ Founders

Etsy, the globally recognized online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, has a fascinating history rooted in the vision of its founders. The company was launched in June 2005 by a small team consisting of Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik. Their journey began with the formation of iospace, and the initial development phase took an impressive two and a half months.

The primary visionary behind Etsy, Rob Kalin, was not only an entrepreneur but also an artist with a deep appreciation for craftsmanship. Born in 1980, Kalin's initial concept for Etsy was to establish an online space that empowered artisans and craftsmen to showcase and sell their unique creations. Drawing inspiration from his background in woodworking and furniture making, he aimed to connect individual artists with a global audience, providing them with a digital platform to thrive.

The name "Etsy" itself carries a unique story. In a 2010 interview with Reader's Digest, Kalin explained his choice of a nonsensical word. Watching Fellini's 8 Â½, he noted the frequent use of "etsi" in Italian, meaning 'oh, yes.' In Greek, Etsy translates to "just because," adding a touch of whimsy to the platform's identity.

The early years saw Etsy gaining traction, attracting investments from notable individuals and entities such as Sean Meenan, Albert Wenger, Spencer and Judson Ain, Union Square Ventures, and even the founders of Flickr and Delicious. Despite changes in leadership, with Maria Thomas briefly assuming the role of CEO, Kalin's influence on Etsy's ethos remained significant.

In 2009, Josh Silverman took the reins as Etsy's Chief Executive Officer, bringing with him two decades of leadership experience. His background includes key roles at American Express, Skype, shopping.com, eBay, and the co-founding of Evite, Inc. Beyond his corporate roles, Silverman is deeply committed to community and civic engagement, currently serving as Chairman of Code Nation.

While the leadership baton passed from Kalin to Silverman, the essence of Etsy remained true to its founding principles. The platform continues to reflect Kalin's belief in the power of connecting people with unique, handcrafted, and vintage items from around the world.

In essence, Etsy stands as a testament to the creativity and vision of its founders, a digital haven where craftsmanship and individuality thrive in the interconnected global marketplace.

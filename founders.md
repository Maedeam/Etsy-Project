# ðŸ“™ Founders

Etsy was co-founded by Rob Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik in June 2005. However, Rob Kalin is often recognized as the primary visionary behind the creation of Etsy.

Rob Kalin, born in 1980, was an artist and entrepreneur with a passion for craftsmanship and handmade items. His initial vision for Etsy was to establish an online marketplace that would empower artisans and craftsmen to showcase and sell their unique creations. Kalin, who had a background in woodworking and furniture making, aimed to create a platform that would connect individual artists with a global audience, providing them with a space to thrive in the digital age.

Under Kalin's leadership, Etsy grew rapidly, becoming a pioneering force in the realm of e-commerce dedicated to handmade and vintage goods. His commitment to fostering a community of independent creators and promoting sustainable and ethical practices set Etsy apart in the online marketplace landscape.

While Kalin stepped down as CEO in 2009, his influence on Etsy's ethos remains significant. His initial vision of a platform that celebrates craftsmanship, creativity, and individuality has endured and shaped Etsy into the vibrant and diverse community it is today. The platform continues to reflect his belief in the power of connecting people with unique, handcrafted, and vintage items from around the world.

# ðŸ“™ Strategy Horizons

### **Horizon 1**

**Extend and Defend Current Core Activities**

In the realm of Etsy's first strategy horizon, the focus revolves around extending and defending its current core activities. As a premier online marketplace for handcrafted, vintage, and customized products, Etsy has meticulously curated a diverse selection that caters to a global audience. The core business, characterized by the facilitation of transactions between individual artisans (sellers) and discerning buyers seeking unique items, is strategically positioned for extension and defense.

**Extension:** Etsy continually seeks to broaden the scope of its current core activities by expanding its product categories, enhancing user experience, and deepening engagement within its existing community. This involves identifying trends, understanding buyer preferences, and adapting the platform to align with evolving market demands.

**Defense:** Protecting the core business involves implementing measures to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of Etsy's existing marketplace model. This includes addressing challenges, such as competition from other e-commerce platforms, technological advancements, and changing consumer behaviors, through strategic partnerships, technological innovation, and customer-centric initiatives.

This horizon underscores Etsy's commitment to preserving and growing its foundational marketplace, acknowledging the significance of a robust and sustainable core to withstand industry dynamics.

**Innovation:** Etsy actively seeks opportunities to innovate within the e-commerce landscape, exploring emerging trends, technologies, and consumer preferences. This may involve the introduction of new features, services, or even the expansion into complementary markets that align with the ethos of handmade and unique products.

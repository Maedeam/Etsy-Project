## Etsy and Covid-19

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted businesses worldwide, and Etsy was no exception. However, the nature of Etsy's platform, which caters to individual artisans and small businesses, brought both challenges and opportunities during this unprecedented global crisis.

**Challenges:**
